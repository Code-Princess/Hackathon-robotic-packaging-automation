# Hackathon-robotic-packaging-automation
This repository contains the Blockly-based code for the DOBOT MG400 robot, developed during a hackathon project. The robot is equipped with a vacuum gripper and programmed to perform a complete box-packing sequence: folding an unfolded cardboard box, placing an object inside, and sealing the box, ready for shipping.
